Description: Time series analysis, (dis)aggregation and manipulation, e.g. time series extension, merge, projection, lag, lead, delta, moving and cumulative average and product, selection by index, date and year-period, conversion to daily, monthly, quarterly, (semi)annually. Simultaneous equation models definition, estimation, simulation and forecasting with coefficient restrictions, error autocorrelation, exogenization, add-factors, impact and interim multipliers analysis, conditional equation evaluation, endogenous targeting and model renormalization.
