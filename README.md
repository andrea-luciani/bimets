# bimets - Time Series And Econometric Modeling In R


**bimets** is an R package developed with the aim to ease time series analysis and to build up a framework that facilitates the definition, estimation, and simulation of simultaneous equation models.

**bimets** does not depend on compilers or third-party software so it can be freely downloaded and installed on Linux, MS Windows(R) and Mac OSX(R), without any further requirements. 

<!-- For an introduction and examples, visit the [bimets Dev Center](http://bimets.github.com/). 

For bug reports, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bimets/issues
-->
Please consider reading the [package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bimets/vignettes/bimets.pdf), wherein there are figures and the mathematical expressions are better formatted than in html.

If you have general questions about using **bimets**, or for bug reports, please use the [git issue tracker](https://github.com/andrea-luciani/bimets/issues) or write to the [maintainer](mailto:andrea.luciani@bancaditalia.it).

## Features



**TIME SERIES**

- supports daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, yearly time series, and frequency of 24 and 36 periods per year.
- indexing *by date* - users can select and modify a single observation by using the syntax `ts['Date']`, or multiple observations by using `ts['StartDate/EndDate']`.
- indexing *by year-period* - users can select and modify observations by providing a two-dimensional numerical array composed by the year and the period, e.g. `ts[[Year,Period]]`.
- indexing *by observation index* - users can select and modify observations by providing the array of requested indices (core R), e.g. `ts[indices]`.
- *Aggregation/Disaggregation* - the package provides advanced (dis)aggregation capabilities, having linear interpolation capabilities in disaggregation, and aggregation functions (e.g. `STOCK`, `SUM`, `AVE`, etc.) while reducing the time series frequency.
- *Manipulation* - the package provides, among others, the following time series manipulation capabilities: 
time series extension `TSEXTEND()`, 
time series merging `TSMERGE()`, 
time series projection `TSPROJECT()`, 
lag `TSLAG()`, 
lag differences absolute and percentage `TSDELTA()` `TSDELTAP()`, 
cumulative product `CUMPROD()`, 
cumulative sum `CUMSUM()`, 
moving average `MOVAVG()`, 
moving sum `MOVSUM()`, 
time series data presentation `TABIT()`. 


Example:
```r
#create ts
myTS=TIMESERIES((1:100),START=c(2000,1),FREQ='D')
 
myTS[1:3]                         #get first three obs.

myTS['2000-02-03/2000-03-04']     #get Feb 3 up to Mar 4
myTS[[2000,14]]                   #get year 2000 period 14
myTS[[2032,1]]                    #get year 2032 period 1 (out of range)
    
myTS['2000-01-15'] <- 42          #assign to Jan 15, 2000
myTS[[2000,3]]     <- pi          #assign to Jan 3, 2000

myExtendedTS <- TSEXTEND(myTS1,UPTO = c(2020,4),EXTMODE = 'QUADRATIC')

**MODELING:**

**bimets** econometric modeling capabilities comprehend: 

- *Model Definition Language* - the specification of an econometric model is translated and identified by keyword statements which are grouped in a model file, i.e. a plain text file or a `character` R variable with a specific syntax. Collectively, these keyword statements constitute a kind of a **bimets** Model Description Language (i.e. `MDL`). The MDL syntax allows the definition of behavioral equations, technical equations, conditional evaluations during the simulation, and other model properties. 
- *Estimation* - the estimation function `ESTIMATE()` supports Ordinary Least Squares, Instrumental Variables, deterministic linear restrictions on the coefficients, Almon Polynomial Distributed Lags (i.e. `PDL`), autocorrelation of the errors, structural stability analysis (Chow tests).
- *Simulation* - the simulation function `SIMULATE()` supports static, dynamic and forecast simulations, residuals check, partial or total exogenization of endogenous variables, constant adjustment of endogenous variables (i.e. add-factors).
- *Stochastic Simulation* - in the stochastic simulation function `STOCHSIMULATE()` the structural disturbances are given values that have specified stochastic properties. The error terms of the estimated behavioral equation of the model are appropriately perturbed. Identity equations and exogenous variables can be as well perturbed by disturbances that have specified stochastic properties. The model is then solved for each data set with different values of the disturbances. Finally, mean and standard deviation are computed for each simulated endogenous variable.
- *Multipliers Evaluation* - the multipliers evaluation function `MULTMATRIX()` computes the matrix of both impact and interim multipliers for a selected set of endogenous variables, i.e. the `TARGET`, with respect to a selected set of exogenous variables, i.e. the `INSTRUMENT`.
- *Endogenous Targeting* - the "renormalization" function `RENORM()` performs the endogenous targeting of econometric models, which consists of solving the model while interchanging the role of one or more endogenous variables with an equal number of exogenous variables. The procedure determines the values for the `INSTRUMENT` exogenous variables that allow achieving the desired values for the `TARGET` endogenous variables, subject to the constraints given by the equations of the model. This is an approach to economic and monetary policy analysis.
- *Optimal Control* - The optimization consists of maximizing a social welfare function, i.e. the objective-function, depending on exogenous and (simulated) endogenous variables, subject to user constraints plus the constraints imposed by the econometric model equations. Users are allowed to define constraints and objective-functions of any degree, and are allowed to provide different constraints and objective-functions in different optimization time periods.

A Klein's model example, having restrictions, error autocorrelation, and conditional evaluations, follows:

**COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS**

The iterative simulation procedure is the most time-consuming operation of the **bimets** package. For small models, this operation is quite immediate; on the other hand, the simulation of models that count hundreds of equations could last for minutes, especially if the requested operation involves a parallel simulation having hundreds of realizations per equation. This could be the case for the endogenous targeting, the stochastic simulation and the optimal control.

The `SIMULATE` code has been optimized in order to minimize the execution time in these cases.  In terms of computational efficiency, the procedure takes advantage of the fact that multiple datasets are bound together in matrices, therefore in order to achieve a global convergence, the iterative simulation algorithm is executed once for all perturbed datasets. This solution can be viewed as a sort of a SIMD (i.e. Single Instruction Multiple Data) parallel simulation: the `SIMULATE` algorithm transforms time series into matrices and consequently can easily bind multiple datasets by column. At the same time, the single run ensures a fast code execution, while each column in the output matrices represents a stochastic or perturbed realization.

The above approach is even faster if R has been compiled and linked to optimized multi-threaded numerical libraries, e.g. Intel(R) MKL, OpenBlas, Microsoft(R) R Open, etc.

Finally, model equations are pre-fetched into sorted R expressions, and an optimized R environment is defined and reserved to the `SIMULATE` algorithm; this approach removes the overhead usually caused by expression parsing and by the `R` looking for variables inside nested environments. 

**bimets** estimation and simulation results have been compared to the output results of leading commercial econometric software by using several large and complex models.

The models used in the comparison have more than:

- +100  behavioral equations;
- +700  technical identities;
- +500  coefficients;
- +1000 time series of endogenous and exogenous variables;

In these models, we can find equations with restricted coefficients, polynomial distributed lags, error autocorrelation, and conditional evaluation of technical identities; all models have been simulated in static, dynamic, and forecast mode, with exogenization and constant adjustments of endogenous variables, through the use of **bimets** capabilities.

In the +800 endogenous simulated time series over the +20 simulated periods (i.e. more than 16.000 simulated observations), the average percentage difference between **bimets** and leading commercial software results has a magnitude of `10E-7 %`. The difference between results calculated by using different commercial software has the same average magnitude.
